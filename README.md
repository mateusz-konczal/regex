# Learning regular expressions
Examples of basic and more complex regular expressions in the form of 
unit tests. Java was used to learn regular expressions, but they are 
very universal and can be used to work with any technology. Regular 
expressions are used in text validation, searching substrings and 
extracting specific information from text.
